# Natural_Language_Processing_Course
This repository contains the code and resources for the Natural Language Processing (NLP) course assignments at the  University of Tehran,Spring 2023. 

The assignments focuses on implementing various NLP techniques and algorithms to solve a range of language processing tasks.

# CA4 - Transformers
  * Q1: ParsBERT 
  
  The assignment involves analyzing the performance of ParsBERT, a state-of-the-art pre-trained language model specifically designed for Persian text, on the NLI task. We will explore the effects of modifying the architecture and adjusting various parameters of ParsBERT on its accuracy and overall performance.
  * Q2: Zero-Shot Learning
 
  In this question, we aim to design a model that can measure the level of user satisfaction with the food ordered through Snapp Food using zero-shot learning.
